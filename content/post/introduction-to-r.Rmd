## Variables(Identifiers) in R{.t}
- Variables are used to **store data**, whose value can be changed according to our need. 
- A variable is a name given to a memory location, which is used to store values in a computer program.
- Variables in R programming can be used to store numbers (real and complex), words, matrices, and even tables.  
- R is a dynamically programmed language which means that unlike other programming languages, we do not have to declare the data type of a variable before we can use it in our program. 
- Unique name given to variable (function and objects as well) is **identifier**.


## Rules for writing Identifiers in R{.t}
- Identifiers can be a combination of letters, digits, period (.) and underscore (_). 
- It must start with a letter or a period. If it starts with a period, it cannot be followed by a digit.
- It should not start with a number (e.g: 2x) 
- It should not start with a dot followed by a number (e.g: .2x)  
- It should not start with an underscore (e.g: _x) 
- Reserved words in R cannot be used as identifiers(e.g: TRUE, FALSE) 

Basically, there are 5 naming conventions 

- alllowercase: e.g. `myname`
- period.separated: e.g. `new.name`
- underscore_separated: e.g. `my_name`
- lowerCamelCase: e.g. `myName`
- UpperCamelCase: e.g. `MyName`

## Creating Variables{.t}
Using equal(`=`) operator
```{r echo=TRUE}
x = 10 
```
Using leftward(`<-`) operator 
```{r echo=TRUE}
y <- 15  
```

## Reserved Keaywords in R{.t}
- Don’t use any reserved keyword as variable name. List all of reserved words in R by using (?Reserved). 

```{r, echo=TRUE}
?Reserved
```


## Entering Input{.t}
At the R prompt/console we type expressions. 
```{r echo=TRUE}
num <- 10
```
The `<-` symbol is the **assignment** operator. \
The grammar of the language determines whether an expression is complete or not.

## Evaluation{.t}
When a complete expression is entered at the R console, it is evaluated and the result of evaluated expression is returned. The result may be auto-printed. 
```{r}
x <- 10
x
```

```{r}
x <- 10
print(x)
```

```{r}
x <- 10
cat(x)
```
  
## Comments in R{.t}
The # character indicates a comment. 
```{r}
x <- 10 # This is a comment
```
Anything to the right of the # (inlcuding the # itself) is ignored. \
This is only comment character in R. \
R does not support multi-line comments or comment block.

## Data Types in R{.t}
R has five basic data types 

- character(e.g: 'abul', "abul")
- numeric(e.g: 2, 3)
- integer(e.g: 5L)
- complex(e.g: 5i)
- logical(True/False)

## Numbers{.t}
* Numbers in R generally treated as numeric objects(i.e. double precision real numbers)
* If you explicitly want an integer, you need to specify the `L` suffix.
* There is also a special number `Inf` which is represents infinity; e.g. `1 / 0`
* `Inf` can be used in ordinary calculations; e.g. `1/Inf` is `0`
* The value `NaN` represents an undefined value("not a number"); e.g. `0/0` 
* `NaN` can also be thought of as a missing value. 

The numeric constants are 

- integer(`L`)
- double
- complex(`i`) 

## Creating Numeric Objects{.t}


```{r}
# Create numeric object
n <- 5  
```
```{r}
# Check type of object
typeof(n)
```


```{r}
# Create an integer type object 
i = 5L 
```
```{r}
# Check type of object
typeof(i)
```

```{r}
# Create a double type object 
d = 22
```
```{r}

# Check type of object
typeof(d)
```
```{r}
# Create a complex type object 
c = 4i 
```

```{r}
# Check type of object
typeof(c)
```


## Decimal vs Double vs Float{.t}
The Decimal, Double, and Float variable types are different in the way that they store the values. Precision is the main difference where float is a single precision (32 bit) floating point data type, double is a double precision (64 bit) floating point data type and decimal is a 128-bit floating point data type.

* Float - 32 bit (7 digits)
* Double - 64 bit (15-16 digits)
* Decimal - 128 bit (28-29 significant digits)

## Characters{.t}
Character constants can be represented using either single quotes ('') or double quotes ("") as delimiters.

```{r}
# Create a character type object 
char = "Hello"
```
```{r}
# Check type of object 
typeof(char)
```


## Atributes{.t} 
R objects can have attributes 

* names, dimnames 
* dimensions(e.g. matrices, arrays)
* class 
* length 
* other user-defined attributes/metadata

Attributes of an object can be accessed using the `attributes()` function.

## Built-in Constants in R{.t}

```{r}
pi # value of pi 
LETTERS
```

```{r}
month.name 
```


## Operators in R{.t}
- R has many operators to carry out different mathematical and logical operations.
- Operators in R can mainly be classified into the following categories. 
  1. Arithmetic Operators 
  2. Relational Operators
  3. Logical Operators 
  4. Assignment Operators 

## Arithmetic Operators{.t}

```{r}
x <- 10 
y <- 2 
```


```{r}
# Addition
x+y
# Subtraction
2-5
```

```{r}
# Multiplication
2 * 5 

# Division
2 / 5 

# Exponent 
2 ^ 5
```

```{r}
# Modulus(Remainder from division)
2 %% 5

# Integer Division 
2 %/% 5
```

## Logical Operators{.t}
```{r}
# Logical NOT(!)
! TRUE
! FALSE   
```

```{r}
# Logical AND(&&)
TRUE && TRUE
TRUE && FALSE 
FALSE && FALSE 
```

```{r}
# Logical OR(|)
TRUE | TRUE 
TRUE | FALSE 
FALSE | FALSE    
```


## Relational Operators{.t}
```{r}
x <- 10
y <- 5 
# Equality 
x == y 

# Inequality
x != y 

# Less Than 
x < y 
```
```{r}
# Greater Than 
x > y 
# Less or Equal 
x <= y 
# Greater or Equal
x >= y 
```

## What is Data Structures?{.t}
In computer science, a data structure is a data organization, management, and storage format that enables efficient access and modification. More precisely, a data structure is a collection of data values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data. 
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structure)

## Vector{.t}
- Vector is a basic data structure in R. 
- It contains element of the same type. 
- The data types can be logical, integer, double, character, and complex. 
- A vector's type can be checked with the `typeof()` function. 


## Creating Vectors{.t}
- Vectors are generally created using the c() function.
- To create Vectors of consecutive number, the : operator very helpful.
- More complex sequence can be created using seq() function.
```{r}
# Create a vector using c() function 
v1 <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,7) 
# print v1 
v1 
```

```{r}

# Create a vector using : operator 
v2 <- 1:10
# print v2 
v2
```

```{r}
# Create a vector using seq(start, stop, step) function 
v3 <- seq(1, 20, 2) 
# print v3 
v3 
```

```{r}
# Create a vector using seq(start, stop, by = step) function 
v4 <- seq(1, 10, by = .5) 
# print v3 
v4 
```

```{r}
# Numeric Vector
v <- c(0.5, 0.6) 
# Logical Vector 
v <- c(TRUE, FALSE)
# Logical Vector 
v <- c(T, F)
# Character Vector 
v <- c("a", "b")
# Integer Vector 
v <- 1:10 
# Complex Vector 
v <- c(1+0i, 2+0i)
```

## Mixing Objects{.t}
```{r}
# Character 
x <- c(1.7, "a")
# Numeric 
y <- c(TRUE, 2)
# Character 
z <- c("a", TRUE)
```




## Matrix{.t} 
- Matrix is a two dimensional data structure in R programming. 
- Matrix is similar to **vector** but additionally contains the dimension attributes. 
- All attributes of an object can be checked by `attributes()` function. 
- Dimention can be checked by directly with the `dim()` function. 
- We can check if a variable is a matrix or not with the `class()` function.


## Creatinig Matrix{.t}
- Matrix can be created using the `matrix()` function.
- Dimension of the matrix can be defined by passing appropriate value for arguments `nrow ` and ` ncol`.

```{r}
# Create a matrix using matrix function 
mat <- matrix(1:9, nrow = 3, ncol = 3)
# print matrix 
mat 
```

```{r}
# Create a matrix using matrix function: only one dimension  
mat <- matrix(1:9, nrow = 3)
# print matrix 
mat 
```

```{r}
# Create a matrix using matrix function: filling by row-wise 
mat <- matrix(1:9, nrow = 3, byrow = TRUE)
# print matrix 
mat 
```

```{r}
# Create a matrix using matrix function: dimension names 
mat <- matrix(1:9, nrow = 3, dimnames = list(c("X", "Y", "Z"), 
                                             c("A","B","C")))
# print matrix 
mat 
```

## Colnames, Rownames and Dimension of Matrix{.t}
```{r}
# Create a matrix using matrix function 
mat <- matrix(1:9, nrow = 3, dimnames = list(c("X", "Y", "Z"), 
                                             c("A","B","C")))
# Column Names 
colnames(mat) 

# Row Names 
rownames(mat)

# Dimension 
dim(mat)
```

## List{.t}
- List is a data structure having components of mixed data types. 
- A `vector` having all elements of the same type is called atomic vector but a vector having elements of different type is called list. 
- We can check if it's a list with `typeof()` function and find its length using `length()` function.

## Creating List{.t}
List can be created using the `list()` function.
```{r}
# Create a list 
L = list(1, "a", TRUE, 1+3i)
# Print list 
L
```


## Factors{.t}
- Factor is a data structure use for fields that takes only predefined, finite number of values(categorical values)
- Factors are used to represent categorical data and can be ordered and unordered. 


## Creating Factors{.t}
```{r}
# Create a factor using factor() function 
f <- factor(c("yes", "no", "yes", "no"))
# Print factor 
f
```

```{r}
# Check levels 
levels(f)
```

## Data Frame{.t}
-  Data frame is a two dimensional data structure in R. 
- It is a special case of a `list` which has each component of equal length. 
- Each component from the column and contents of the component from rows. 


## Create Data Frame{.t}
```{r}
# Create a Data Frame 
df <- data.frame("Age" = c(21, 22, 14, 15, 16, 23),

      "Married" = factor(c("yes", "no", "yes", "no", "yes", "yes")))
# Print Data Frame 
df
```


## Exploring Data Frame{.t}
```{r}
# Dimension 
dim(df) 

# Data Structures

```

```{r}
# Create a vector 
x <- c("a", "b", "c", "d", "e")

# Extract data using : 
x[1:3]

# Extract data using c() function 
x[c(1, 3, 4)]
```

```{r}
# Create a vector 
x <- c(1, 20, 21, 11, 23, 40, 42)

# Extract data using relational operator
x[x > 32]
```

## Subsetting List{.t}
```{r}

} else if(bmi <= 25 && bmi < 30 ){
  print("overweight")
} else {
  print("obese")
}
```


## `ifelse` function {.t}
- Vectors form the basic building block of R programming. 
- Most of the functions in R take vector as input and output resultant vector. 
- This vectorization of code, will be much faster than applying the same function to each element of the vector indivodually. 
- Similar concept, there is a vector equivalent form of the `if...else` statement in R, the `ifelse()` function. 

```r
ifelse(condition, x, y)
```

## Functions in R{.t}
- A function is a set of statements organized together to perform a specific task. 
- R has a large number of in-built functions and the user can create their own functions. 
- In R, a function is an object so the R interpreter is able to pass control to the function, along with arguments that may be necessary for the function to accomplish the actions. 
- The function in turn performs its task and returns control to the interpreter as well as any result which may be stored in other objects.

## Two Types of Function in R{.t}
- Built-in: R has many in-built functions which can be directly called in the program without defining them first.
- User Defined: We can also create and use our own functions referred as user defined functions.
- Simple examples of in-built functions are `seq()`, `mean()`, `max()`, `sum()` and paste(...) etc. They are directly called by user written programs.


## Creating Functions in R{.t}
```{r}
f <- function() {
  # empty function
}
# Function have their own class 

class(f) 

# Execute / Call this function
f()
```

## Create a Hello World Function{.t}
```{r}
# Create a function with no arguments 
say_hello <- function() {
    cat("Hello World\n") 
}
# Call 
say_hello()
```


## Create a function for printitng Hello World 3 times{.t}
```{r}
say_hello <- function(num) {
    for(i in seq_len(num)) {
        cat("Hello World!\n")
    }
}

# Call function with arguments 
say_hello(3)

```
