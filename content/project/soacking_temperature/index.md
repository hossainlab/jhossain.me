## Introduction
The aim of the experiment was to see how soaking temperature affected the length increase in beans (*Phaseolus vulgaris*) when they were soaked in water for 12 hours. The two temperatures used for soaking were room temperature and refrigerator temperature.

## Materials Methods 
The experiment was performed by allocating 30 dry beans at random to each temperature treatment conditional on the constraint that we have equal numbers of short, medium and long beans in each temperature treatment. The beans were labelled in order to keep track of the beans. The cold’s treatment water was chilled before the beans were immersed. After the beans were soaked for 12 hours, each bean’s-soaked length was recorded. The data was recorded in an excel sheet.

The statistical analyses used to analyze the results was independent sample t test. This test investigates whether there is a significant difference in the means of two independent groups. The two temperature treatments are independent thus the justification to use this type of test. Before the test was conducted the assumptions, which were investigated included the assumption of normality and the assumption of constant variance. The Q-Q plot, Anderson-Darling test and the Shapiro-Wilks test was used to test for normality, Box plot was used to test for the presence of outliers in the data. The Levene’s and Bartlett's test was used to detect the presence of heteroscedasticity in the data.
