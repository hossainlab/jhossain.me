  Bio-Bio-1 is a voluntary not-for-profit organization, formed by some passionate individuals in late 2008 to learn Bioinformatics for making some senses from the Enigma of Life. It also aims to spread the excitement of Research and Development by infecting the like-minded individuals (especially the young ones) through several programs (i.e.: weekly Study Circles). I was an active participant of their weekly study circle and learned a lot from them, especially I learned bioinformatics techniques with help of Python.
