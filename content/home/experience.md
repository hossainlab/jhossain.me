  Bio-Bio-1 is a voluntary, non-profit organization formed by some passionate individuals in late 2008 to learn Bioinformatics for making some sense from the Enigma of Life. It also aims to spread the excitement of Research and Development by infecting like-minded individuals (especially the young ones) through several programs (i.e., weekly Study Circles). I was an active participant in their weekly study circle and learned a lot from them; especially, I learned bioinformatics techniques with the help of Python.
