I am a Microbiology Master’s student at [Jagannath University](https://jnu.ac.bd/dept/portal/web/microbiology) and a Health Data Science enthusiast. Health data science, bioinformatics, public health are some of my research interests. I founded the Health Data Research Organization as well.

The [Health Data Research Organization (HDRO)](https://hdrobd.org/) is a non-profit organization dedicated to scientific research and dissemination using primary and secondary sources and third-party data. Students and young professionals with expertise in biological science and health science run the organization, supervised by university faculty members in the life sciences.

Python is my primary language for data mining and machine learning. I also have a basic understanding of R and SQL.
