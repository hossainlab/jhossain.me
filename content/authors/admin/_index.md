I am a Master's student of Microbiology at [Jagannath University](https://jnu.ac.bd/dept/portal/web/microbiology) and Health Data Science Enthusiastic. My research interests are health data science, bioinformatics, microscopic image analysis, drug discovery and machine learning. I am also the founder of [Health Data Research Organization](https://hdrobd.org/). The Health Data Research Organization (HDRO) is a non-profit organization for research and dissemination of scientific information from secondary-sources/ third-party data. The organization is run by students and young professionals from biological science and health science backgrounds, supervised by faculty members from the life sciences of universities.

I use mostly Python for data analysis and machine learning task.
